# Before Contributing
It is recommended to clone the entire repository, then edit/create files. GitHub accounts are required for code to be merged, as you get credit for your work.

# Submiting Contributions
Be sure your edited/new language file takes the format of `language.extension`, it must also be in its designated folder. For example, C++ would have the file name `C++.cpp` and is located in the `C/` folder.
The text required to output (to the console, or UI) is `Hello, World!`.
Once the language is implemented and in the correct folder, run the `list_langs.py` file (Requires Python 3 to work).
The Python file should have added your new language to the readme file.
Once everything is done, you can commit your changes and do a pull request on the repo. This allows us to verify and implement your changes.
Any questions/comments/concerns can be answered by the **Lead Contributers**.
